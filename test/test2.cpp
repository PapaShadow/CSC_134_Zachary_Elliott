/*
Using what you learned during the lecture with arrays, write a C++ 
program that has an array of 10 integer elements. You should create an 
array variable that takes the integer value of 10 and initializes the 
array to this value. For example, if array is supposed to be 10 grades, 
then the array should be initialized with 10 array elements. 
Next, for each grade, you should prompt the user to enter the grade 
value as an integer. When all grades have been entered, then you should 
calculate the average for the grades and print the result to the console

/*
 Design and write a program that accepts an integer input from the user and 
 use the ofstream object to create a new file named lab4.txt. 
 Take the integer value entered by the user and implement a for-loop to loop over
  n-number of times, where n is the value entered by the user and write each iteration of the 
  loop to the file. For example, if the user enters 4, then you should write 0 1 2 3 to the file with 
  each value on a new line without any spaces between each line. Make sure you use the close() method to
   close the file and then print "Done Writing...." to the console when the program is complete.
